I just uploaded the new version v0.17.19 for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.

Everybody needs to upgrade to this version before the next hard fork. The hard fork will happen on 28 September, 10:00 UTC. (The mobile wallet also needs to be updated.)

On this day we will switch to X16RV2. Also some other improvements will become active (better privacy, random salt for AES encryption). 

When you convert from BitCash into BitCash Dollars and back the blockchain will now be able to store a min and max acceptable price. Version v0.17.19 will set this price range to +- 3% of the current price. This could be changed later if needed. The important thing is, that the blockchain will now be able to store this information. If a large price jump happens shortly after you sent the transaction and before it has been mined into a block, this mechanism will protect you so that you do not get a unacceptable price. The transaction will be removed from mempool if the price is out of range. You can then abandon the transaction and create a new transaction if you want. Or you can wait until the price is in the price range again and rebroadcast the transaction.
